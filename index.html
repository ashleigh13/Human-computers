    <p>Human computers go back all the way to 1939 with Barbara Canright.
      She was hired by NASA to do calculations, much like a computer would, 
      figuring how many jets it takes to lift a space craft and other 
      difficult equations. These calculations would take several weeks to 
      complete at times and it was very tiring work for one person.<br> Later, 
      during the space race, NASA hired on more "computers" to help Barbara out.
      This role was held by mostly women and was the first job to lead in a 
      form of womens rights.

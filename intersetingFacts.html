    <p>If you've ever wondered how people ever got along without smartphones,
      much less calculators? Try this on for size: the scientists who calculated when 
      Halley's Comet would return in 1757 did it with goose-quill pen and paper. 
      Early computers were sometimes male students however, according to David Skinner 
      women had largest taken over by the early 20th century. Katherine Johnson calculated 
      the trajectory of the first American's journey into space. Dorothy Vaughan, 32years 
      old high school teacher started her new job and became a Grade P1 mathematician. She 
      helped with the wartime effort at LMAL. NASA was the prime aircraft test facility, they 
      were racing to make combat planes fly further, faster, and on less fuel. Mary Jackson 
      worked on experimental supersonic aircraft. She analysed how air flowed over every tiny 
      feature, right down to the rivets. Jackson was later invited to work in the wind tunnel 
      after two years in the computing pool. In order for her to earn this new position she had 
      to take graduate-level courses after work hours. With special permission to sit in the 
      all-white classes and become NASA's first black female engineer. Maruam Mann started 
      working for Langley computer in 1943, thinking she would only be working there as long 
      as the war effort needed her. Her story inspired and empowered people. Christine Darden 
      sent 25 years learning how to keep quiet, but she was never one to stay quiet. Mainly balck 
      women were to human computer. Hidden figures tells a story of a African american women who 
      worked as a mathematicians for NASA. This story shows how women were contributing like Katherine 
      Johnson, Dorothy Vauhgan, and Mary Jackson.</p>
